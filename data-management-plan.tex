The data in the proposed project is primarily source code for the open
source project to be developed.  This project has an existing
repository that contains the existing source code, to which the PI has
full access.

Documentation and curricular items associated with any tools will also be stored in
an open source repository, since in this project the primary
educational benefits are linked to the use of these tools.  Using GitHub automatically provides us with excellent backup
and archiving for the code and curricular material products of the
project.

We have no unusual format or metadata requirements; the
tools involved primarily use textual formats that are easy to store
and read or byte-based formats that are interpreted only by fuzzer
drivers or code under test.
